Tutorials and recources:

//Generally I begin with a main plugin file (which would be this) and use it to assemble all the others together.
//It is good practice to segment your code into different files. This is a good technique for including them:
require_once (plugin_dir_path(__FILE__).'/admin/admin.php');
require_once (plugin_dir_path(__FILE__).'/shortcodes.php');
